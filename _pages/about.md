Welcome to my website!

I am currently a sencond-year Ph.D. student at [School of Information](https://slais.ubc.ca/), The University of British Columbia. My superviser is [Dr. Muhammad Abdul-Mageed](https://mageed.arts.ubc.ca/). My research are natural language with deep learning and social media mining. 

I obatain my M.Sc degree of Data Analytics at Clarkson University under the supervison of [Dr. Boris Jukic](https://www.clarkson.edu/people/boris-jukic), and received my Bachelor of Management Information System from [Xiamen University of Technology](http://english.xmut.edu.cn/) under the supervision of Dr. Yihui Qiu.
